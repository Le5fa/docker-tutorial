# A simple Docker tutorial

This repo contains the support material for a short class about docker for
developers.

This tutorial is based on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) version 17.09.0-ce (build afdb6d4) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) version
1.16.1, (build 6d1ac21).

You can get a [recent versions of Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
that runs natively on GNU/Linux, OS X and Windows; alternatively, you can use
[Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) to run Docker via
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), or on various cloud providers.

## Slides

The [slides](slides/) directory contains the slides of the lecture (also   [browsable](http://broad-foot.surge.sh/) online). The [network_example](slides/network_example) directory contain few (undocumented) scripts to run the example presented in the last slides.

## Examples

The lecture presents the following two use cases.

### Compile (and execute) code in different languages

The [compile](compile/) directory shows how to leverage
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to compile, and execute, a simple "Hello,
world!" applicaiton in several langauges.


###Â An example web application

The [webapp](webapp/) directory contains a couple of `Dockerfile`s and a few scripts used
for a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) tutorial based on the [Python WebSockets
Chat](https://github.com/heroku-examples/python-websockets-chat) example
application by [Kenneth Reitz](http://www.kennethreitz.org/).

The chat application is based on [gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) and
[redis](http://redis.io/), this repo contains (among other files):

* a [Dockerfile](webapp/gunicorn/Dockerfile) to build a suitable `dt/gunicorn` image, and
* a [Dockerfile](webapp/chat/Dockerfile) (that derives from the `dt/gunicorn` image) that
  encapsulates the application in the `dt/chat` image;
* a [run.sh](webapp/chat/run.sh) script show how to run the official `redis`
  [image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/redis/), and how to run the `dt/chat` image using
  the new [networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/) features to make
  it talk to the the redis server, persisting the application logs in a locally attached
  [volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/).
* a [docker-compose.yml](webapp/docker-compose.yml) configuration file to run the application using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (instead of the abovementioned scripts),
